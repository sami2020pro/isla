## Code of conduct
We want to cultivate a respectful and constructive environment for everyone involved, and we expect all other contributors to do the same. Please use Github's reporting features if you have any concerns.

## Ways to contribute
<br />

### Getting started
Before working on an issue, fork the project and create a feature branch. Once you're done working, rebase your changes against the main branch and submit a pull request.

All pull requests must be fully tested before they're submitted for review.

We use the **conventional commit** pattern for our commit messages. Commit messages should include a "type" and a short description (e.g. `fix: add helper methods to show correct trace in sentry (#75)`). For new features, it sometimes makes sense to add a longer description as well. Acceptable commit message types include:

* feat (a new feature)
* fix (a bug fix)
* perf (a performance improvement)
* refactor (a change that improves upon existing code)
* docs (a change to the docs only)
* test (a change that only includes tests)
* chore (a change to CI, etc)

Advance option just for author:

* update (a new update)

Lastly, make sure your commit is signed before submitting the pull request.

### Fixing bugs
Open a pull request with the patch, and please include a description that clearly describes the problem and solution and references a relevant issue number if applicable. Please also include a test case that covers the previous bug so that the issue won't occur again.

### Adding new features
If you have an idea for a new feature, please first discuss it with us with submit a new issue tagged with the `enhancement` label. If we decide to adopt the feature, you're also welcome to submit a pull request if you have the time and inclination for it. Currently, we have no strict requirements around the design of new features. However, we ask that you try to follow the conventions of the current codebase, and feel free to discuss any design issues before submitting.

### Fixing whitespace, formatting code, or making purely cosmetic patches
Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of this package will generally not be accepted.
